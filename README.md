### Day one

I've learned the basics of it, what it is, how numbers works here,
understood that it isn't about numbers but about calls, but if I referee numbers
in this README is because I'm taking them as numbers, since all calls
do `++i` and I'm using it to test the numbers of call.

`SUCESSOR` function kept me thinking all the time while I was doing it.
Understand it isn't hard itself, but the way I wrote functions and call
them and also the names of params are keeping me confuse, but I want to
stay doing it in this way, eventually it won't be a problem anymore,
need to improve my logic, and it has being a really good exercise
