### Day one

I've learned the basics of it, what it is, how numbers works here, understood
that it isn't about numbers but about calls, but if I referee numbers in this
README is because I'm taking them as numbers, since all calls do `++i` and I'm
using it to test the numbers of call.

`SUCESSOR` function kept me thinking all the time while I was doing it.
Understand it isn't hard itself, it basically gets the first number and calls
once more, but the way I wrote functions and call them and also the names of
params are keeping me confuse, but I want to stay doing it in this way,
eventually it won't be a problem anymore, need to improve my logic, and it has
being a really good exercise

### Day two

Here I've done `sum`, `mult` and `exp` functions, it is a huge exercise, really
helpfull and helped me understand a little bit more about lambda functions and
how it interacts with each other, really cool see how it is going.

`Sum` was really simple to do, basically it runs the first number the number of
times it runs the second number, so if I have, `ONE` and `TWO` it will run
`TWO` first and twice, and then the result of it, will be the argument for the
`ONE` function callback

`MULT` was kind of confusing at first, but when I realized that it's callback
should execute the another number instead of calls the count callback, it went
good and "easy", but with this functions I finally got how things actually
works

`EXP` was wrong, will be fixing it by tomorrow, forgot to test it with
different values, and when I realized, already pushed to github and it was
actually an multiplication instead of exponentiation
